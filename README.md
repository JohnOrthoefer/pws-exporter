# pws-exporter
Prometheus exporter for wunderground Personal Weather Stations protocol

Lots to add to this document about how to set it up.   That is coming soon.  I just wrote the code about a week ago and only tonight cleaned up the code enough to publish.

Right now some of the options are  just stubs and it only works as far as I know with the AcuRite 5-in-1 weather station.  

Todo
- [ ] Add in the filter and log options
- [ ] Add in an option for your own config.yaml file
- [ ] Make the station id and password options do what they should
- [ ] Write detailed directions about how to set this up
- [ ] Add prometheus config
